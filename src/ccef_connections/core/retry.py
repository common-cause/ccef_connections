# ── What is safe to retry ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every decorator below retries rate limiting (HTTP 429) and nothing else.
# That is deliberate and applies across all services:
#
#   * A 429 means the request was *rejected* — nothing was applied server-side,
#     so replaying it cannot duplicate an effect. Safe to retry.
#   * A 4xx (auth, not-found, validation) will never succeed on attempt 2.
#     Retrying only delays the error message that says what to fix.
#   * A 5xx leaves the request in an *unknown* state. Several methods here are
#     not idempotent — SheetsWriterConnector.get_or_create_spreadsheet,
#     AirtableConnector.batch_upsert, ActionNetworkConnector.create_person —
#     so replaying a 5xx risks a duplicate write. Surface it and let the caller
#     decide.
#   * An exception from our own code (KeyError, TypeError, AttributeError) is a
#     bug. Retrying it turns an instant traceback into a 30-second wait that
#     reads like a network problem.
#
# Do not add bare ``Exception`` to a retry predicate. It silently swallows all
# four cases above, and because ``reraise=True`` surfaces the right error in the
# end, the only visible symptom is unexplained slowness.

    A missing PTV_API_KEY_PASSWORD was the worst case — connect() wraps

    Losing retry on real transport blips is the accepted trade: the connector

def retry_snowflake_operation(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    """
    Decorator for Snowflake operations with retry logic.

    Retries rate limiting and nothing else, per the module policy above. For
    Snowflake that leaves very little, and deliberately so:

    * ``snowflake-connector-python`` already retries transient network failures
      internally, the same way ``google-cloud-bigquery`` does — so a transport error
      that reaches us has already been retried and should surface.
    * ⚠ **A statement timeout must never be retried.** ``READER_WH`` caps statements
      at 60 seconds at the *warehouse* level and ``PUBLIC`` cannot raise it, so a
      query that timed out will time out again. Retrying spends three more minutes
      failing and makes a deterministic limit look like a flaky one.
    * An IP-allowlist rejection, a bad password, a missing object and a read-only
      violation are all permanent until a human changes something.
